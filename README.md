Old computational methods projects done in upper-division undergrad.

/nbody folder holds all files related to solving an n-body simulation of a 10x10x10 lattice of Xenon atoms in two potentials, the Lennard-Jones (6-12) and Morse.  This model uses simple verlet integration for each time step.

/nbodyrk4 folder holds all files related to solving an n-body simulation of a 10x10x10 lattice of Xenon atoms in two potentials, Lennard-Jones (6-12) and Morse. This iteration uses fourth order Runge-Kutta to solve.

/quantum folder holds all files related to solving for the three dimensional wavefunctions of an electron within a three-dimensional gaussian potential well using trigonometric basis functions.

/ssheateq folder holds all files related to solving for the steady-state solution of the heat equation on a cubic satellite with one side facing the sun and the other facing the earth.  Hard-coded linear system solving implemented here.

/theateq folder holds all files related to solving the time-dependent heat equation for a cubic satellite with one side facing the sun and the other facing the earth.

/isingmodel folder holds all files related to implementing a Monte-Carlo simulation to simulate the behavior of ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramegnetic iron materials under various magnetic fields and temperatures, which could be used to identify the Curie and Neel temperatures of the material in question.

/finalproj folder holds files related to an attempt to model a three-stage rocket (parameters for the NASA space shuttle were used) while taking into account drag, variable mass, and implementing a simple control to go into orbit.  Another folder on my github account contains a working version of this simulation, which was completed for a later course.
