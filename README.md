Old computational methods projects done in upper-division undergrad.

/nbody folder holds all files related to solving an n-body simulation of a 10x10x10 lattice of Xenon atoms in two potentials, the Lennard-Jones (6-12) and Morse.  This model uses simple verlet integration for each time step.

/nbodyrk4 folder holds all files related to solving an n-body simulation of a 10x10x10 lattice of Xenon atoms in two potentials, Lennard-Jones (6-12) and Morse. This iteration uses fourth order Runge-Kutta to solve.
